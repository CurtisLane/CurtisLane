# Bio

## My specialties include: the MERN stack, MongoDB, Express, React, Node, mySQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ES6, Bootstrap, and more!

### 🤹🏻

### The reason I became a developer is because I'm fascinated by technology, I love language learning, and I'm passionate about turning a vision of what could be, into reality. I have developed quite a skill set in the arts of execution, discipline, and problem solving. 

### 😤

### My story begins at the end of high school in 2007. I had a choice to pursue my passion for either computer science, or anatomy and physiology. The choice was easy, I wanted to help people right now with my knowledge of the human body, so for the next decade my focus was on building the most outstanding massage therapy and personal training practice possible. 

### 💪

### After eleven years of wear and tear on my body I realized that the more sustainable choice would have been computer science. I've kept up with the changes in technology since high school and beginning in 2017 I've been ALL IN, learning everything I can about web development from multiple online courses and a six month intensive boot camp with the University of Central Florida. 

### 📚

### I'm driven, excited, motivated, disciplined, and have already built a successful career once. I plan to do the same again as a developer. My massage therapy career officially ended in March of 2020 when I was laid off due to the covid-19 pandemic. The day I got the email was the day I started as a full stack developer.
